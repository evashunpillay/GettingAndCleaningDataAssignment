## Variables

### Subject
Experiment Participant - There were 30 participants in total. Each participant in the data set is represented numerically.

### Activity

There were six activities in total. The activity and associated numerical representation is shown below:

id	name

1	WALKING

2	WALKING_UPSTAIRS

3	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

4	SITTING

5	STANDING

6	LAYING

### Features

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. Each of them that were obtained from that data are shown below:

tBodyAcc-XYZ

tGravityAcc-XYZ

tBodyAccJerk-XYZ

tBodyGyro-XYZ

tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ

tBodyAccMag

tGravityAccMag

tBodyAccJerkMag

tBodyGyroMag

tBodyGyroJerkMag

fBodyAcc-XYZ

fBodyAccJerk-XYZ

fBodyGyro-XYZ

fBodyAccMag

fBodyAccJerkMag

fBodyGyroMag

fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value

std(): Standard deviation

mad(): Median absolute deviation 

max(): Largest value in array

min(): Smallest value in array

sma(): Signal magnitude area

energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 

iqr(): Interquartile range 

entropy(): Signal entropy

arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4

correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals

maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude

meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 

kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 

bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.

angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean

tBodyAccMean

tBodyAccJerkMean

tBodyGyroMean

tBodyGyroJerkMean
